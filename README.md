project ideas
<ul>
  <li>mobile app that sends messages about absence in college to people that need to know. Also create reason why you were absent and prints out the explanation letter (or creates pdf)</li>
  <li>Notebook with theory and stuff from all different sources. All in one app (django presumably - one module is one topic e.g. git or web). Capabilities: search, test, etc.</li>
</ul>
